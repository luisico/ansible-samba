Samba
======
Install [Samba](https://www.samba.org/samba/what_is_samba.html) server.

This role supports 'server', 'client' and 'member' roles.
For clients (default), `samba-client` is installed along with some dependencies, but do not prepare mounts or set up any configuration.
For servers, the configuration is done via a `smb.conf` template managed by a few variables (see `defaults/main.yml` for details).
For domain member servers, the configuration is done via a `smb.conf` = `krb5.conf` template managed by a few variables (see `defaults/main.yml` for details).
You can configure any global option in dict `samba_global`, except the workgroup, which is configured in `samba_workgroup`.
Any number of shares can be configure in dict `samba_shares`. Directories for defined samba shares will be created.

When using Samba's `user` security model (default), users in `samba_users` will be setup in the samba context, but note you still need to define them at the OS context (ie `/etc/passwd`, LDAP, ...).

Note that at least ports 139/tcp and 445/tcp need to be open for servers and clients.
